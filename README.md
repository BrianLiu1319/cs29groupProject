Things still need to be done:

- GameClock
    - Continually update objects to see if they need to fire
 
- Tower functions
  -  Fire Function
    -  Need to Create Bullet

- Add grid 
  - 2D array

- Drag & Drop

- Attacker / Defender Derivatives

- Thread?

- Integrate Main Menu ( maybe later )

- Animations for every class ( idle fire death etc .... )





How our Base Class Works:

          |
        Collider
     /      |           \
 Attacker   Defender    Bullet
    |           |
Derivatives  Derivatives
